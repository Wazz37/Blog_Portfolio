Create a portfolio, that I will host on any server where I will publish my blogs.
Create a front page and write about me. I am an Research Engineer working on Deep Learning, Transformers, ComputerVision etc. And I have 2.5 years of exp as ADAS engineer.

This portfolio will be for writing blogs of my own. 
Create this webpage like "TowardsDataScience" and it should be black and white and should be very good frontend and very used friendly. 

I want to host it on server where I will buy a domain. Make sure that, created code should be able to host on any domain.
